I have recently finished my master studies in CS at ETH Zurich. In fact, I think Informatik sounds better than Computer Science. I have been working on the restoration of both synthetic and real images, and my current focus is on the synthetic side, more specifically, how to reconstruct rendered images from a handful of light transport samples. 

A lot of my spare time is spent with my girlfriend (manually showing a heart :P) who also gives a lot of helpful advice on this website. Besides, I play 2 games: [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) and [minesweeper](http://www.minesweeper.info/worldranking.html). Therefore, I can say I am somehow good at controlling the mouse. 

Feel free to drop an [email](mailto:xyzhang.qd@gmail.com) if you are interested in what I do or play!

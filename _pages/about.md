I am currently a third-year PhD student in Peking University. I have been working on the environment and health impact on solid fuel use in China and some relative policy evaluation. 

I love travelling around the world. So far, I've been to more than 20 provinces in China and more than 25 states & cities outside of China. I also like playing games: board games and minesweeper.

Feel free to drop an [email](mailto:wjmeng@pku.edu.cn) if you are interested in what I do or play!
